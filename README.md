**Piano Session Multi-Angle Recorder**

This application enables users to record piano sessions from multiple angles and subsequently upload the recordings to a Laravel server. Users have the flexibility to record using a USB camera or connect an external camera via a QR code generated by the Laravel server.

**Components:**

**mic.py**: Manages audio recording using a USB microphone.

**camera.py**: Oversees video recording from the camera.

A server-client architecture is utilized to control the start/stop functions for both the camera and microphone recordings.

**Repository Structure:**
Each "Level" directory represents a foundational stage of the application:

1. It serves as a backup before progressing to the next developmental stage, ensuring safety against any malfunctions.
2. Provides a roadmap for future developers aiming to understand or replicate the project from its basics.

**Learning Points:**
1. Recording audio with Python.
2. Video recording using cv2.
3. Establishing a server-client relationship with sockets.
4. Crafting a GUI for user authentication and master controls.
5. Automating processes with scripts and terminal termination using subprocess.

**How to Run:**

Execute the command: python3 login.py

**Workflow:**

1. A login page appears. User credentials are verified against the Laravel server's registered data.
2. Choose the musical score for the recording session.
3. Launch the server. The system will automatically detect and use any connected microphone and camera.
4. Connect an external camera by scanning a QR code, which is generated by the Laravel server.
5. Initiate the recording.
6. Terminate the recording.
7. Shut down the server.
